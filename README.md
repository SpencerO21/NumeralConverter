# NumeralConverter
A work in progress Roman numeral to decimal number converter.
It works for most numbers with a few exceptions. It does not work with Roman Numerals in which you have to subtract (ex. XIV does not print 14). 
I spent 3.5 hours working on this project. Also, I spent an additional 20 minutes setting up the repo.
